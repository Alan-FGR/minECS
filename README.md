![minECS Logo](minECS.png) 

## 

This branch contains version 3 of minECS. See other branches for previous versions.

This is a full rewrite of minECS, it's now faster than ever, uses Roslyn source generation extensively in order to deliver performance as fast as writing thousands of lines of boring code that micro-manages memory.

.NET6 is required
